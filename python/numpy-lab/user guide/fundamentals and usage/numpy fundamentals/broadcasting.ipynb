    "The term broadcasting describes how NumPy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations. There are, however, cases where broadcasting is a bad idea because it leads to inefficient use of memory that slows computation.\n",

    "## General Broadcasting Rules\n",
    "When operating on two arrays, NumPy compares their shapes element-wise. It starts with the trailing (i.e. rightmost) dimension and works its way left. Two dimensions are compatible when\n",
    "\n",
    "they are equal, or\n",
    "\n",
    "one of them is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these conditions are not met, a ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together exception is thrown, indicating that the arrays have incompatible shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input arrays do not need to have the same number of dimensions. The resulting array will have the same number of dimensions as the input array with the greatest number of dimensions, where the size of each dimension is the largest size of the corresponding dimension among the input arrays. Note that missing dimensions are assumed to have size one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a 256x256x3 array of RGB values, and you want to scale each color in the image by a different value, you can multiply the image by a one-dimensional array with 3 values. Lining up the sizes of the trailing axes of these arrays according to the broadcast rules, shows that they are compatible:\n",
    "\n",
    "Image  (3d array): 256 x 256 x 3\n",
    "Scale  (1d array):             3\n",
    "Result (3d array): 256 x 256 x 3\n",
    "When either of the dimensions compared is one, the other is used. In other words, dimensions with size 1 are stretched or “copied” to match the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, both the A and B arrays have axes with length one that are expanded to a larger size during the broadcast operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A      (4d array):  8 x 1 x 6 x 1\n",
    "B      (3d array):      7 x 1 x 5\n",

    "## Broadcastable arrays\n",
    "A set of arrays is called “broadcastable” to the same shape if the above rules produce a valid result.\n",

    "c acts like a (1,6) array and therefore like a (5,6) array where c[:] is broadcast to every row, and finally,\n",
